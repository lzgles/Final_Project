Foundations of R for Data Analysis
Final Project

This repository is from a study on legacy sediments conducted on the Big Elk 
watershed in Maryland. From the 17th to the 19th century, settlers constructed 
mill dams which accumulated deposits of fine sediments that entered the 
watershed as a result of deforestation and agriculture practices. When these 
dams are removed, sediment is released into the watershed by erosion processes. 
The goal of the study was to examine the microbial community and determine 
nutrient and heavy metal content of legacy sediments to gain insight into the 
effects on water quality as the sediment deposits erode into streams. 

There are three data files. One is an ASV table (Amplicon Sequence Variant) 
representing the microbial community (Microbial_Community.csv)
which is constructed from high-throughput sequencing data. One contains sediment 
measurements (Sediment_Characteristics.csv) including chemistry, particle size, 
nutrient content, and gene quantity. One contains sample site locations 
(Site_coordinates.csv).
